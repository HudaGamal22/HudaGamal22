## About Me

üë©‚Äçüíª I am a passionate software engineer with a background in Computer and Control Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering at Alshorouk Academy. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in full-stack development through a comprehensive diploma program at Almadrasa.com.

In the Winter of 2022, I participated in the Maker Diploma program, where I developed the ability to conceptualize, model, and create medium-fidelity prototypes of smart devices or solutions. You can explore my documentation for the final project [here](https://sites.google.com/san3atech.com/md22w-huda/final-project-journal?authuser=0).

My interests span across software engineering, problem-solving, and innovative solutions that make a difference. I have a particular passion for accessibility technology, demonstrated through my graduation project - smart glasses for visually impaired individuals, which utilized Python algorithms to transform visual information into auditory cues.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I've participated twice in the ECPC, showcasing my problem-solving prowess and commitment to excellence.
